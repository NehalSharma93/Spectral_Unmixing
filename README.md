# Spectral_Unmixing
This project aims at finding different components (eg land/water) in a pixel of a satellite image.

The remote sensing instrumentation measures the spectral radiance reﬂected or emitted within its instantaneous ﬁeld of view (IFOV). At target level, this means to sense the spectral radiance reﬂected or emitted by a ﬁnite target area (pixel). The pixel size in present-day remote sensing systems is large enough to include different types of land cover. Hence spectral unmixing aims at ﬁnding the different components present wihtin a pixel.

The Constrained Least Squares (CLS) mixing model to generate fraction images derived from remote sensing multispectral data are presented. An experiment on simulated data with 3 components (buildings, vegetation and water) was done and algorithm was designed to perform unmixing. Keywords: IFOV, pixel, multispectral, unmixing, CLS

Tools used: Grass GIS(for spectral band maps), Jupyter Notebook
